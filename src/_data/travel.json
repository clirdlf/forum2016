        "blurb": "<p>I am very excited to be attending the DLF Forum this fall as an ER&L cross-pollinator. As the Discovery Systems Librarian, my goal is to promote the discovery and access of all of the Libraries’ resources through a single interface. This goes beyond traditional print materials and subscribed electronic resources and extends to digital repository collections, digitized resources, data sets, and more. I hope to learn more about digital collections at the DLF forum, so that I can improve the discovery and access of such materials for the library users at the University of Houston.</p>"

While most of my day-to-day work is focused on managing electronic resources, I am also interested in digital collections, repositories, metadata, user experience and open access. I am excited to be given the opportunity to attend this year’s DLF Forum and learn from colleagues working in similar fields. In order for us to meet our users’ constantly evolving research and informational needs, collaboration is essential.</p>"
