I have an MLIS in library science from Kent State, and an MA in anthropology from Texas A&amp;M\u2014I\u2019d love to talk with you if we have shared interests!<\/p>"

A Chicana born outside the U.S., I have worked as library instructor with the Pima County Public Library for years, focused on providing access to information for our local Hispanic and Native peoples; after recent work with Special Collections at both the UA and UC San Diego, my goal now is to also ensure that our communities have a documented presence in the archives as well as access and an understanding of what those archives contain. A firm believer in interdisciplinary collaboration, I am eager to attend the DLF Forum to network and exchange ideas on the use of digital tools for effective outreach, the optimization of catalogs and repositories to facilitate discovery, access and preservation of cultural materials, and to further efforts in indigenous language revitalization.<\/p>"
