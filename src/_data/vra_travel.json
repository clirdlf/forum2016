        "blurb": "<p>I'm the Visual Resources Librarian for Islamic Architecture in the Aga Khan Documentation Center (AKDC) at MIT, part of the MIT Libraries. In that role, I provide access to the Documentation Center\u2019s visual collections for the MIT community and for a worldwide community of users. As part of the AKDC team, I also contribute content to Archnet, the largest open, online architectural library with a focus on Muslim cultures. This will be my first DLF Forum, and I\u2019m looking forward to meeting a new community of people, learning about the work being done at other institutions, and the opportunity to bring back new ideas to MIT and to VRA. I\u2019m excited to represent VRA at the Forum, and for increased communication and collaboration between the two organizations.<\/p>"
