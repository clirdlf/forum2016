I\u2019m working to create and document effective workflow procedures for capture, accessibility, description, and preservation of born-digital art resources at NYARC, which consists of the research libraries of The Frick Art Reference Library, The Museum of Modern Art, and The Brooklyn Museum. I\u2019m very excited to attend my first DLF Forum this fall in Vancouver and am grateful for the opportunity to make new connections, gain insight, and share information with colleagues from diverse perspectives in the museum and library environments.<\/p>"

I rely on my library and information science background to do this, and as I continue to develop professionally, it has become clear to me that museums, archives, and libraries face similar challenges when it comes to digital initiatives. Working with large data sets, data integration across multiple systems, and linked open data are topics relevant to current DMA initiatives and I look forward to discussing these in particular with colleagues at the DLF Forum.<\/p>"

Recently, I was honored to represent my institution in Glasgow, Scotland after we were nominated for the 2015 European Museum of the Year Award (EMYA).<\/p><p>Hopefully, my participation at the Forum will help me develop digital media strategies and look into new business models, so as to manage our digital content with creativity. I also hope we will discuss the boundaries between new technologies and cultural heritage in museums and libraries, especially concerning their interpretation, consumption and interaction with audiences.<\/p>"
